# Abstract
The intricate shapes and sounds that arise from vibrating Chladni plates are a well-known phenomenon. They are
also quantitatively well understood, as the spatial patterns correspond to the eigenvectors of the underlying plate,
and the audio frequencies arise from the plate’s eigenvalues. We explore a generalization of the phenomenon by
computing analogous quantities for a computational fluid dynamics simulation. Unlike the Chladni plate case, direct
analytic expressions are not available, so we instead compute a set of “empirical” eigenvectors and eigenvalues. We
find that these vectors form abstract, turbulent patterns in space. In another departure from the Chladni plate case,
the eigenvalues no longer have a natural sonic mapping, so we construct a sonification that allows us to “listen” to
the eigenvectors of the fluid. The united visual and sonic forms comprise a multimodal compositional palette that
has great artistic potential.
